In the Property struct within the RealEstateFractionalize smart contract, the value and salePrice fields serve distinct purposes:

value
Purpose: Represents the total value of the property when it is registered.
Usage: This is a static measure of the property's worth as defined during its registration.
Type: uint256
Example: If a property is registered with a value of 100 ether, value is set to 100 ether. This is typically the total estimated worth or the initial fractional value of the property.
salePrice
Purpose: Represents the price at which the property or fractions of it are listed for sale.
Usage: This is a dynamic measure used when the owner decides to sell the property or fractions of it. It indicates the selling price the owner expects to receive from buyers.
Type: uint256
Example: If the owner decides to sell the entire property for 150 ether, salePrice is set to 150 ether. Alternatively, if fractions are being sold, salePrice may reflect the price per fraction.
Key Differences
Initialization:

value is set when the property is first registered and generally does not change.
salePrice is set when the property is listed for sale and can be updated each time the property or its fractions are put up for sale.
Purpose:

value is used to define the total worth of the property, which can help in determining the fractional ownership value.
salePrice is used to define the actual selling price during a sale transaction, which could be for the entire property or specific fractions.
Context:

value helps in understanding the proportion of ownership and overall worth of the property.
salePrice is critical in transactions, determining how much buyers need to pay to acquire the property or fractions of it.
Example Scenario
Property Registration:

Owner registers a property with a value of 100 ether.
This means the total property is considered to be worth 100 ether.
Listing for Sale:

Owner lists the property for sale with a salePrice of 150 ether.
This means the owner wants to sell the entire property for 150 ether, or fractions based on a proportional value.
Fractional Sale:

If the property is being fractionally sold, and the owner decides to sell 10% of the property, the salePrice for that fraction could be 15 ether (10% of 150 ether).
By having both value and salePrice, the smart contract can differentiate between the inherent worth of the property and the price at which the owner is willing to sell it, providing flexibility in transactions and pricing.
